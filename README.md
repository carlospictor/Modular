Modular content loading with jQuery

Inspired by the article here:
http://filamentgroup.com/lab/ajax_includes_modular_content/

But a custom version to teach myself how to code jQuery plugins from scratch.
I also wanted to be able to have additional behaviours/interactions besides auto-loading. 

This script also allows click and viewport events to be utilised.
